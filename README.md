## General info
The purpose of this project is to provide an online presence for the Mzamotsha primary school.
 Moreover this project was also created by the contributors to learn HTML, CSS & the Flexbox model technology? 

Motivation: Mzamomtsha Primary school is located between Khayelistha Township and Umfuleni Township in the Western Cape Province, the school was initially created for primary school students from grade 1 to grade 7, but due to the rapid population growth (births and migration) the school is also enrolling higher grades. The school's rapid growth has led to a series of problems for the Mzamomtsha Primary School. There is not enough infrastructure and educators to accommodate the number of students and the school has no online presence. This website is built to help reduce some of those problems.
